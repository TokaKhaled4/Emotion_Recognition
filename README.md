# Emotion Recognition Project

This project is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Emotion Classification Using CNN
In this part, users can upload an image, and our deep learning model classifies the emotion into categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc. The model was trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and is deployed via Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.

### 2. Real-Time Emotion Recognition Using DeepFace and OpenCV
The second part of the project focuses on real-time emotion recognition. By running a simple cell, the camera opens, and using DeepFace with OpenCV, the system recognizes and classifies the user's emotion in real-time.

## Features
- **Image-based emotion classification** using CNN.
- **Real-time emotion recognition** via camera using DeepFace and OpenCV.
- **User-friendly interface** for image classification deployed with Streamlit.
  
## Dataset
The model was trained using the [Kaggle Emotion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).
